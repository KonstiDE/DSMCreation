# Deep Neural Network Regression for Digital Surface Model Generation with Sentinel-2 Imagery

This is the code of the paper "Deep Neural Network Regression for Digital Surface Model Generation with Sentinel-2 Imagery".
The repository contains all three model variants (branches) of U-Net (V1-Baseline, V2-Multiscaled and V3-Attention) and our model for comparison, Adabins, in the within the four branches including the all scripts supporting the network regarding data preparation or postprocessing. Please note, that `V3-Attention` is refered with a `v4` suffix in the files. The finished paper can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189905
